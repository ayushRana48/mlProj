Person identification from a surveillance video with image annotations in a live stream. The goal of this project was to point out a person-of-interest based on a set of soft biometric attributes from a surveillance video without prior knowledge. The concept of Gait Soft-Biometric was used and the identification and re-identification of a person based on attributes such as gender, appearance, anthropometrics are used to detect the potential criminal activity at places where security is very essential.

My role was to study the literature and thoroughly in order to develop a highly accurate Machine Learning Model upon extracting the features from the GEI and classify a person based on different traits. After that one can find out a person of interest by query processing in a multi-connected surveillance network that will be made live at the industrial level after completion of the project. To locate the person in the surveillance video, we extended the work of Facebook research of MASK-RCNN to efficiently detect a person in the video while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for that person. This project was funded by the Government of India.

As a vise president, I organized and coordinated several events by collaborating with UNESCO to promote the World Heritage Volunteers Program. The events took place at various world heritage sites in the state of Gujarat and more than 200 volunteers joined across the globe and participated in the program. I managed and coordinated several events, workshops during my tenure as a vice president. The biggest learning point for me was to interact and connect with people around the world. This not only helped me to enhance my leadership skills but I was able to help build a society that is more aware of such initiatives and encourages everyone to give back to the society.

Developed the first scalable media distribution solution for P2P networks encompassing heterogeneous and mobile platforms. In 2005, the project was offered the seed-stage funding by Siemens Technology to Business Center at Berkeley, CA.

Solved the optimal capacity utilization problem in overlay multicast by proving the problem solvable in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hard Steiner tree problem in IP multicast.

Proved the optimal multicast routing problem solvable by using network coding and proposed the distributed routing algorithm applicable to a variety of optimization objectives, e.g., minimum delay or energy consumption.

• Led the design and implementation of a  robust Test Framework for a high-throughput in-memory key value data store,  which allows to write, dispatch and run tests against a fleet of datastore nodes independent of the platform or the version each node is running on, enabling to tackle pre production bugs, cross-version compatibility issue, configuration issues, and performance degradation issues. The test framework could be run either on actual bare metal hosts, or docker containers, or individual network namespaces on a single host.
• Delivered a fully functional environment where each node process could be run locally on individual network namespaces without the use of any docker containers or external hardware, supporting full isolation.
• Enhanced the Service Gateway product's Continuous Traffic Test Suite, which periodically tests most common customer workflows, by integrating with Resource Principal Authentication, and migrating to an in-house Test Service scheduler.  https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm

Member of MATLAB Enterprise Deployment team, currently working on the product MATLAB
Production Server (MPS) to provide deployment solutions for MATLAB based applications in a 
client-server environment to solve important issues like scalability and reliability. Working to provide solutions to Java, .NET, Python and Excel clients.

• Currently working on adding support for an Asynchronous Client API for the Java MPS Client. The API provides Future-based results and a listener interface for status updates. The internal 
implementation must keep state for every outstanding request on multiple server instances and 
update them as the request state changes on the server.

• Designed and implemented an API, in Java and C#, that allows users to dynamically invoke 
MATLAB functions deployed on the server. This required a full refactoring of the existing client 
code for both languages.

• Designed and implemented the Python MLArray, a multi-dimensional array implementation for 
Python that could be serialized/deserialized to/from MATLAB. This is a core component of the 
MATLAB Python interface which is used by multiple teams inside MathWorks.

• Designed and implemented the Python Client and user-facing API for the MATLAB Production 
Server. Users can now call MATLAB functions deployed on the production server from Python. 
The client is responsible for encoding/decoding between Python and MATLAB data structures; 
providing access to MATLAB functions available on the server; and interacting with the server 
through a RESTful API.

• Worked on data conversion library for marshaling non scalar data between MATLAB types and 
types supported by other languages like Java, C# and Excel, using Google Protocol Buffers for data serialization.

I wore many hats at Twitter because, looking around, there was always something that could be improved – even if I wasn't explicitly assigned to.

Most recently, I was the Tech Lead of the Home Timeline Performance team of 11 engineers where I drove cross-functional technical strategy alignment across EMs/PMs/engineers, set technical standards, and mentored ICs from SWE II to Staff. In our last quarter, we decreased Tweet loading latency by 11%.

Before that, I drove impact through shipping Tweets and security/privacy-related features, architecting developer experience infrastructure to make it easy for feature engineers to follow best practices, and mentoring 10 feature engineers as Healthy Privacy Tech Lead. Here are some numerical bangers from then:
- Increased daily Tweets sent by 850k
- Saved Twitter.com engineers 450 engineering hours per month
- Increased PWA daily install rate by 8.5x
- Saved Twitter hundreds of millions of dollars in privacy/security-related regulatory fines
- Taught 2 recurring engineering education classes
- Helped keep Twitter Lite's 1 million users & expand to the Windows Store
- Shipped server-side rendering for Twitter.com's React app
- Developed the first marketing & communications strategy as a chair for Twitter Able, Twitter’s Business Resource Group for disabled employees/employees with disabilities

In addition to constantly finding myself new technical problems, I was the domain expert for large swaths of our codebase (internationalized rich text, testing infrastructure, Twemoji, feature flags, PWAs, cookies, etc), mentoring engineers on other teams and leveling up their ability to teach & learn from each other. I regularly gave feedback on web standards proposals and open source libraries through partnerships with Google, Microsoft, and Meta. I also open sourced the Twemoji Regex Generator after maintaining it for 3 years.

I created a visual editor for feature switches YAML files using Blockly and React, preventing malformed configuration rules which would've resulted in errors in production. I also created a PageHeader React component for Twitter’s internal frontend framework, speeding up over a dozen people’s daily work. I implemented an Empty State redesign and confirmation popup for Twitter Lite, rescuing in-progress tweets from deletion. Also created a course for Twitter University called Active Learning focused on increasing learning retention by 0.47 standard deviations.

I wrote a constraint-balancing algorithm which solved the NP-complete problem of creating class schedules. I also implemented team designer’s learning interface redesigns using Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and Sass which allowed students to better understand their upcoming assignments and classes. Above all, the most fun part was building a feature that allowed students to check recently graded assignments and class contributions using Django and Backbone, being a student myself.

As the Android technical lead for the Tweets team I worked with a group of 10+ Android engineers to ship a number of products and performance improvements to Twitter for Android. Actively participated in recruiting, and hiring of engineers. Provided mentorship to engineers, tech leads, and product managers. Worked with stakeholders to coordinate product and technical strategy.

Most recently I was the primary driver of the Mixed Media project which allowed users to mix videos, photos, and gifs into a single Tweet. Worked with various teams to get buy-in for the project. Partnered with other leads to get consensus on a number of technical problems. Holdback showed an increase of 10M user active minutes per day and a significant increase in retweets.

I also worked with our infra team to create an ambitious 3 year strategy to improve developer productivity. After 2 years we were able to reduce build times for Tweets components by 90%. We estimated that a developer would save 8+ hours of build time over 4 weeks. This was accomplished through better modularization, feature sandboxes, and improved documentation.

Developed and evaluated an Android port of the TENA Middleware. The TENA Middleware enables rapid development of distributed real-time applications. This is part of a larger effort to enable TENA on a variety of mobile/embedded platforms. 

Previously, worked as lead software engineer responsible for developing ground software components for Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) initiative to adapt the FINDER Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) for use as an off board sensing platform. Two key components included sensor guidance and a H.264/MPEG-2 viewer. Sensor guidance is used to dynamically reposition the UAS to follow a ground based moving target based on sensor input. The H.264/MPEG-2 viewer displays video from the sensor along with an overlay containing mission critical information. These two components reduced the crew requirements from two (pilot and sensor operator) to one (sensor operator).

As the lead software engineer on the SYKBUS Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) UAS, developed the SKYBUS GCS. Leveraged existing code from FINDER program and added additional modules for LTA operations. By reusing code we were able to significantly reduce development and testing time.

Supported Cloud Platform Technology and Platform Engineering Teams; created and maintained numerous cloud infrastructure related tools in PHP/Symfony and Ruby on Rails.

Selected Project Accomplishments:
• Designed from scratch and, using Ruby on Rails with MySQL and Rake tasks, implemented new ETL system for collecting customer business data metrics, a multi-stage pipeline request processing system with a multi-threading worker pool. The long time broken ETL process, caused by ever-growing customers and metrics which are distributed in more and more datacenters, finally worked again:
o Achieved high performance and scalability through three levels of parallelism: framework level parallel computing support, framework level distributed computing support, and worker level support. 
o Collected data metrics from various data sources including different MySQL endpoints and restful API. 
• Designed and produced blacklist tool, a state machine based workflow for a vital business process for managing marketing email complaints; the blacklist tool incorporated Jira, Salesforce, email parsing, and restful API of private systems, executed on Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and Rake tasks.
• Created and implemented database maintenance tool to automate the orchestration between Nagios monitoring system and Tungsten database clusters; the tool was built upon Sinatra/Ruby and Ruote (Ruby workflow engine) with restful web service/API on Nginx server for integration.

Worked on designing an Evanescent mode Band pass Filter which was used at the ground station of a satellite as a part of the Down Converter Circuit. 

Developed a C code to calculate the dimensions of the bandpass filter. The design of the hardware was developed using NX-CAD which was handed over to the Hardware department who gave life to our design. Once the value of the carrier frequency was selected according to the requirements of the satellite, the bandwidth was calculated according to the C code along with the dimensions of the bandpass circuit, and the width where the screws to be tuned had to be put. 
Upon creation of the Hardware, the manual tuning of the circuit was done and the results were captured on a Virtual Network Analyser (VNA).

Designed and built Web Application to program Configuration Matrix creation for a platform to test new features 
Used C#, Net 4.0, REST API and SQL Server 2016 to create a web application that can enable a user to create a configuration file from the Product Distribution List (PDL) file.
The manual creation is a tedious and erroneous task. With my application, the configuration file could be created in a few clicks.
With my project, all the files will be saved on a single server thereby enforcing data consistency. 
Got a chance to work on various tools like AXON, JIRA, QMETRY, CONFLUENCE etc.
Automated test cases using Python and Axon workflow.

I founded Neo Rostrum Inc. a C-Corporation during the commencement of year 2006. Neo Rostrum is an Italian word where ‘Neo’ stands for New & ‘Rostrum’ stands for Platform. I founded Neo Rostrum Inc with a vision of formulating a newer platform of doing business the right way. During my professional socializing at business communities I realized & learned that the upcoming decade or so (2008 - 2016) was destined to uproot businesses at USA & start-ups survival was next to impossible, so to assist Neo Rostrum Inc survive I successfully planned & pushed Neo Rostrum Inc ‘into dormant state by end of year 2006’ to be resurrected post a decade. Dormant state in a way that Neo Rostrum Inc continued to file its Federal & State Taxations Annually but maintained a very-low-profile of no-profit no-loss status all the way through the decade. As year 2016 commenced, I began the process of Resurrecting Neo Rostrum Inc to bring it back into business. On September 9th 2016 (numerological 999) I succeeded in securing private share investors into Neo Rostrum Inc’s for a good of $500 per share stock price at times when investment market at USA was sloppy and in red. Between September to December of 2016, I successfully convinced United States Postal Service to issue Neo Rostrum Inc a CAPS Account, a Corporate Account & a Bulk Mail Permit, I successfully convinced Bank of America to re-instate Neo Rostrum Inc into its customer pool of Small Businesses, I closely worked with California Franchise Tax Board (CAFTB) in settling arrears of taxes that CAFTB had on books for Neo Rostrum Inc (CAFTB levies $800/- default tax), I paid all the dues in full and CAFTB credited Neo Rostrum Inc account with the excessive payment amount under the particulars of Estimated Taxes, I closed a business deal of providing a Year Long Contractual Information Technology Services to a major renowned Identity Protection Company at USA that serves to almost all of the USA nation.

Driving next generation design & architecture of 2 systems critical to Uber's Build Infrastructure.

- SubmitQueue: Conceived & developed an innovative scheduling system that keeps large monorepos shippable at all times even with 1000s of commits/hr. 

- uCI: Creator of uCI, a generic, scalable task-execution/orchestration system that leverages mesos for powering CI & other stateful workloads at Uber.

Submit Queue:
100s of engineers committing changes concurrently to a repository leads to frequent master breakages. Explored & conceived a new system called ""SubmitQueue"" that guarantees an ""always-green"" master in this context. At Uber, Submit Queue handles 100s of commits/hr submitted by ~1000 of engineers every day.

Individual contributions made:
-- Came up the idea of speculatively executing builds that are mostly likely to succeed to scale the system to 100s of commits/hr.
-- Designed and implemented a conflict analyzer to detect if two changes are likely to conflict or not using the build system.
-- Built Machine Learning models that continuously learn & estimate the likelihood of changes to pass builds.
-- Architected the system to handle 100s of repositories, failover-active in all of Uber's regions.
-- Published a research paper at Eurosys'19 introducing SubmitQueue and detailing its core components.

uCI - a reliable task execution/orchestration system for stateful workloads:
Laid the foundation for a world class CI Infrastructure at Uber by replacing Jenkins with a scalable task execution system that leverages mesos for cluster management.

During my time on this project I developed patterns for a synchronized cache layer leveraging Ember Data, significantly reducing redundant API calls, and allowing for instantaneous optimistic client-side updates. I was also able to boost route transition and render performance by 2-4x (worst case) and 10-20x (best case) and introduce viewport based lazy load and render occlusion culling to our web application.

The RESTful API was created using a hapi.js server layer, a PostreSQL database, and a custom module to track A/B statistics via Optimizely; this was paired with an administrative front end written in React with Okta authentication for privileged tasks. Additionally, I worked to develop various other UI components for the loan applications using Angular 1.x.

I developed an internal tool to gather and aggregate data in real time using ASP.NET, with an Oracle database, Visual Basic backend, and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This tool to allowed for teams to track their overall progress while taking on tasks through a series of easy to read metric visualizations. I also created scripts to aid in workflow automation by pulling desired information from multiple different sources and formatting it into desired reports to be used by project managers.

In Adobe I was a part of Adobe Experience Manager, Forms (AEM Forms) core team. It is a platform that helps customers to create dynamic forms and combine them into workflows for their organizations. 

1. Integrated Adobe Sign in the AEM workflow. It was an asynchronously process implemented by multithreading. Threads kept on polling the Adobe Sign service to check for the user’s action, later they callback the workflow when the user signs the document.
2. Added the support for 2 way SSL authentication using Java in AEM on the web.
3. Adobe Experience Manager desktop application runs in a cluster within each organization. Each node represents one instance of AEM forms. Created the health monitor dashboard that periodically pinged the health status of each node which can be visualized on the admin console itself.
4. LiveCycle Configuration Manager (LCM) Update - LCM is an installation software of Adobe Experience Manager Forms. It performs several sets of operations to set up AEM Forms on the customer’s system. Operations such as configuring the application server, configuring the database, Content repositories, Deploying WAR’s, initializing pdf generator etc. I was the sole owner of this software to help clients for updates and installation both by GUI and CLI.

-- Designed hardware in CAD and simulated simple cellphone assembly procedures in ABB RobotStudio. 
-- Involved in the design of the format of the file called Assembly Decomposition File (ADF). This file is basically a text file with the description of the motion parameters (Quaternions, Cartesian coordinates, vacuum gripper state, type of motion, Tool Center Point details, etc) for the robot to carry out the assembly.
-- Wrote a parser in C++ language that takes in an ADF file, reads it line-by-line and executes the motions on an actual ABB IRB140 Robot.
-- Implemented randomization of initial pose of one of the parts in the two-part assembly, so that a certain uncertainty exists in its location before the process begins. This was towards simulating a more ""industry like"" environment, where we can imagine these parts coming in on simple conveyor belts.

-- Involved in the design, development and deployment of a standalone learning tool that learns force signatures captured during execution of cellphone part assemblies with the ABB IRB140 Robot. Main objective of this algorithm was to differentiate successful assemblies from failed ones, based on assembly-time forces.
-- Used the libSVM library to implement a non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF kernel). The tool was written in C++ language.
-- Successfully trained and tested the learning software on different types of cellphone parts, e.g a cellphone-battery assembly, a PCB-shieldcan assembly, cellphone-battery cover assembly, etc.
-- Wrote the wrapper class and topic/service node for a single-axis force sensor in a Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. My class implementation wrapped around the standard POSIX serial read/write API functions. I was able to log force data to a text file using this software. Implementation was done in C++ language.
-- Developed software for inter-OS communication between Ubuntu & Windows 7. The model was a standard client-server model with simple string parsing that occurred over TCP/IP. Strings were passed from client to server and vice-versa, along with some indicator metadata. The class structures wrapped around the standard Winsock and Berkeley Sockets API functions. Code was developed in C++ language. 
-- Primary motive of the above inter-OS parser was to be able to use MATLAB functionality installed on a Windows system, in Ubuntu. The server class in Windows also wrapped many MATLAB engine library functions. Standard hand-shake protocol was followed.

My class implementation wrapped around the standard POSIX serial read/write API functions. I was able to log force data to a text file using this software. Implementation was done in C++ language. -- Developed software for inter-OS communication between Ubuntu & Windows 7. The model was a standard client-server model with simple string parsing that occurred over TCP/IP. Strings were passed from client to server and vice-versa, along with some indicator metadata. The class structures wrapped around the standard Winsock and Berkeley Sockets API functions. Code was developed in C++ language. -- Primary motive of the above inter-OS parser was to be able to use MATLAB functionality installed on a Windows system, in Ubuntu. The server class in Windows also wrapped many MATLAB engine library functions. Standard hand-shake protocol was followed."

As a software engineer in the Privacy Aware Infrastructure at Twitter, I got the opportunity to work in some exciting projects: 
- Translated business rules into Drools rules for analyzing millions of datasets across 30 odd storage systems all over Twitter, to check if they are under compliance or in some bad state
- Developed Notisphere in a team of 3 engineers which has multiple workers and backend apis to power up notifications like email, Jira or slack. Our client is expected to setup a template and then just request to send out the notification to respective recipients by hydrating those templates with their corresponding information. 
- Developed mule integration flows that connected 3 different sources of information, coagulated it and updated that data in Collibra. This data was then used to power up some very important downstream application that informed teams all over Twitter about their datasets which were out of compliance. This mule integration workflow was also designed to digest information about any Re-Org and updated all relevant systems with 100% accuracy without any human intervention
- To maintain data compliance, created a data model to store dataset meta details (owner, reason of use, etc) which is of immense importance during audits and tracing data usage lineage.

As a software engineer in the Identity Org at PayPal, I got an opportunity to do some interesting data analysis on a set of backend APIs which were consuming a lot of resources and were still very slow and the numbers clearly indicated that they are read heavy APIs but the code is not optimized to support it. I was able to propose couple of solutions to optimize them. I laid out a plan, designed the final solution to optimize those for heavy read operations.

Worked in the Exchange Directory and Authentication team, responsible for administering and developing a large scale distributed directory that is used by Office 365 (Exchange Online). Serve as domain expert in the directory space for troubleshooting, diagnostics and root cause analysis.

Highlights
• Worked on building a horizontally scalable Directory module to support billion+ mailboxes with low latency and high availability
• Developed a scalable server wide Directory Cache service that plugged into Exchange Data Access Layer to speed up login access time by 71% (cold case) and by 35% (warm case). Caching makes access unnoticeable for high level components, allowing consumers programming against the DAL to get the benefit of caching out the box. 
• Implemented the Exchange Topology Discovery Service, a highly scalable and reliable service that handles discovery and suitability testing for hundreds of domain controllers This service makes heavy use of multithreading, scheduling algorithms, asynchronous programming, LDAP programming, concurrency control and WCF.
• Developed a solution to handle the Domain Controllers Maintenance Mode (MM), reducing the number of alerts from using servers that were not supposed to be in rotation. This resulted on a healthier on-call experience and less errors in the service. 
• Implementation of an automated and redundant Exchange Online Active Directory Database backup that is core in the Directory disaster recovery strategy. 

Exchange Optics Team
Fixed and stabilized a critical component part of Exchange Optics pipeline (Pumper) that is used for analysis and reporting of Exchange Datacenter behavior; increasing the availability of the component from 80% to 99% and the complete optics pipeline to 97%.

- Designed a lag monitoring service for Kafka called Kafka Observer which allows customers to monitor both offset-based and time-based lag for each consumer subscribed to a topic. Also designed the REST API and client for this service which allows customers to query and change the status of their Kafka consumers. The state was restorable from a periodically check pointed in Manhattan - Twitter’s internal NoSql database.

- Implemented rate limiting in Apache Kafka which allows engineers to set bandwidth rate limits on a per-broker-per-tenant basis. This was integrated with a metadata service which served as a control plane for configuring these limits on the fly for each individual unit. This was extensible towards a global distributed rate limiting implementation. 

- Implemented multiple features in Scala services related to Kafka metadata provisioning, replication and management.

- Wrote 3 detailed post-mortems for Sev-1 and Sev-2 incidents affecting the real time status of Backend Storage services at Twitter.

- Mentored and onboarded multiple engineers and provided guidance to interns during onboarding and shipping of early features in the team. Also conducted ~10 engineering interviews for SWE1 and 2.

Designed and implemented the end to end streaming pipeline for the ML ingestion platform. This included components like the REST interface for injecting data and orchestrating the pipeline, followed by the Apache Spark Structured Streaming application and infrastructure responsible for aggregating and transforming the data and executing the ML models running on TensorFlow.

- Designed a manager responsible for dynamically creating new streaming application instances and monitoring existing ones which routed incoming sensor data to different ML models depending on ML model specific rules. The manager was also responsible for keeping track of state in a database.

- The frameworks/technologies used were Apache Kafka for the messaging backbone, Apache Spark Structured Streaming for streaming (with the Standalone cluster deployment config used with Apache Livy for hosting the cluster on AWS) and Scala as the implementation language. 

- The REST interface for the manager was developed in Sanic - the async Python web framework, along with GINO as the ORM.

Worked on the Symantec Endpoint Protection Cloud(SEPC) product in the reporting and dashboard microservices team. 

- Prototyped and contributed in the development of a generalised report generation framework which allows consumers of this framework to write metadata widgets describing the entities to be displayed in the report, and the views which are to be written in html/css that style this data. This abstracts the consumers from writing raw SQL queries, and reduces the efforts to style the report. This framework is now being consumed by various other teams in Symantec.

- Designed and implemented Apache Storm topologies which are at the core of real time ETL infrastructure for the product platform. These consume live event data generated by consumer devices and ingest their aggregated output into the db. The data layer is flexible enough to allow different sink connectors, and hence it allows multiple databases to be used as backend stores. This data is later used for the generation of reports/dashboards which display aggregated information through various types of charts and graphs.

- Contributed in the development of REST APIs which allowed consumers to submit report/dashboard templates and receive the finished product, created by using the reporting framework mentioned above.

The project was to design and implement a modified version of Localized Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is faster and more accurate than standard libraries. The modified SVM first clusters the data using K-NN and K-Means clustering algorithm and then applies a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) based SVM on each cluster, thereby deriving a consensus SVM model that is later used for classification and prediction purpose. Random Fourier Features were used for feature selection and optimization.

My experiments clearly showed that our modified SVM was more efficient (more accurate) and fast when compared to standard available tools like LIBSVM and LLSVM upon running both on standard datasets.

I was responsible for design and leadership in large functional areas including search, application development, text analysis, and simple things that turn out to be hard like opening up mail documents. 

The most rewarding accomplishments were those where I worked with others. I led the team that created APIs to enable business partners to extend the product. I bridged the gap between advanced research and the market by creating the Live Text framework. I worked with Google to build the plugin that allows Google Desktop Enterprise to search Notes content.

 Communicating the vision of the company to its own technical staff, to industry groups, and to the technical trade press. Engaged these groups with terms from their own domain and with the personal credentials to be respected.

 Led and managed the R&D labs that involve significant technologies to the company. Build internal expertise in new areas and create young new leaders.

Created a software that moves petabytes of HFDS data from any private and/or public cloud (like Walmart Data Center) to another one (like Azure's HDInsight or Amazon's EMR) that utilizes MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) pattern to achieve the lowest possible total transfer time - that is only limited by hardware (disc or network bandwidth) and as efficient as possible (low CPU/memory/resources utilization)

Performance Results
To transfer an HDFS snapshot between hosts we are able to transfer data at a throttled 580 Mbytes/sec even across long distance, high latency links (e.g. France to Colorado). That's 3x the speed of the previous highly optimized HTTP-based solution (like Hadoop's DistCp ) and with less strain on the system.

 - Developed a desktop application using Electron shell which in-turn rendered a Progressive Web App built using React-js with Flux-Alt, web-pack. It had around 100K DAU for 2 months.
 - Developed an app called CricQuest where users can answer some real time questions based on the currently happening cricket match and win prizes. Was responsible for the implementation of the Progressive Web App and then the Native Android App which served around 5k users. Was also partly responsible for doing the server side stuff using Google Appengine in python environment.

○ Laid down the entire architecture for the android application made to browse through the BlueStacks TV live streams and other twitch channels in a team of 3.

○ The guy behind the development of BlueStacks Payment SDK - A payment gateway compatible with existing Google Play Billing API to enable indie app publishing. This project lead to a great hands-on on the entire stack ranging form the client side Android Application, Interaction with android framework, Android IPC, Cloud Application on Google App Engine (python) and Google's No-Sql DataStore.

Worked on some cutting edge stuff with Bluestacks R&D innovation center at Gurgaon. Technologies worked upon: Android(primary), GoogleAppEngine - Python, Ios (Objective-c & Swift), Node js, Firebase, HTML, Angular Material, CSS, Angular Js, React-Flux-Webpack, javascript, Jquery & C#. ○ As a part of the R&D team - Created an ios application (using Swift) solely and worked on and off on the ios sdk that communicated with our webrtc management server for call initiation and management. - Developed a desktop application using Electron shell which in-turn rendered a Progressive Web App built using React-js with Flux-Alt, web-pack.

Research Scientist (Cryptographer) -- Intel Labs.

At Intel Labs, my research is focused on Post-Quantum Cryptography (e.g., Hash-Based Signatures, Code-Based Cryptography, Lattice-Based Cryptography, Isogeny Based Cryptography and Multivariate-Quadratic Crypto) and lightweight cryptography (lightweight block ciphers, hash functions, authentication, attestation mechanisms, etc).

I am a contributor to international standardization efforts on Cryptography. In particular, I am serving as an expert member of the USA delegation for ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 (IT Security techniques) Work Group 2 (Cryptography and security mechanisms) and an expert member of the INCITS (the central U.S. forum dedicated to creating technology standards) on Cyber Security (CS1). 

Besides my research track, I am the architect and maintainer of TinyCrypt (https://01.org/tinycrypt), a small-footprint cryptography library targeting constrained devices written in C. I implemented the following cryptographic algorithms in TinyCrypt: AES-128, SHA-256, CBC mode, CCM mode, CMAC mode, CTR mode, EC-DH key exchange, EC-DSA signatures, HMAC-SHA256 and HMAC-PRNG. TinyCrypt is currently used in several open-source projects, including the Zephyr Operation System (https://www.zephyrproject.org/) and the Intel System Studio (https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-system-studio).

I am also part of the SAFE-Crypto core team, which is responsible for evaluating and approving the usage of cryptography in any mechanism at Intel.

Development of my doctoral thesis:

Subject: Public-key cryptography based on error-correcting codes.

Contextualization: The main hindrance for the practical use of public-key code-based cryptography was its huge public-key sizes (hundreds of kilobytes for reasonable security levels). 

My thesis (main results): Proposition of two different approaches that significantly reduce the public-key size of code-based cryptosystems. One is based on the use of algebraic codes (Quasi-Dyadic Goppa Codes) and another on the use of graph-based codes (Quasi-Cyclic Moderate-Density Parity-Check Codes). In summary, both proposals managed to reduce the public-key size to values comparable to those presented by the RSA scheme, a cryptosystem largely used in practice. Moreover the QC-MDPC proposal strengthens the security-proof of the standard code-based cryptosystems by using codes free of algebraic structure. 

My thesis (complementary results): 
- Extension of the Quasi-Dyadic Goppa proposal for: 1) digital signature scheme; 2) codes defined over finite fields of characteristics greater than two.
- New decoding algorithm for square-free Goppa codes.
- Extension of the Quasi-Cyclic MDPC proposal for cyclic-symmetric codes.
- Preliminary results on the possibility of using random linear codes to instantiate public-key code-based cryptosystems.

Automation today is hard because computers do not understand natural language and they force the programmers to think about edge cases up front. We are solving both of these pain points. We are bringing the power of programming to all. Business around the world will now be able to hyper-automate in a way that is impossible with RPA.

Effort: Functional Correctness

About: 
Functional Correctness is one of the three primary health pillars for the Facebook Apps; other two being - Stability (crash reliability), and Performance. Its mission is ""to ensure that the Facebook Family of Apps just work"".

Contributions:
- Piloted the use of machine learning classifiers to mine through large volumes of user feedback to surface the top meaningful buckets of issues that users feel the most pained by, thus kick starting the effort that later came to be known as Functional Correctness. 
- Collectively scaled the effort from an experimental project with 1 Facebook App product team to an established program run by 28 Facebook App product teams (with other tooling & product partners).
- Leading this cross-functional effort to now scale across 5 partner orgs (Facebook App, Instagram, Messenger, AdsManager and Workplace), also setting the long term direction and vision for Functional Correctness.
- Actively working as the solutions architect for a framework to systematically address user feedback on the applications, as well as prevent future failures through centralized instrumentation strategies.

Joyce retuned to India in 2007 after spending 13 years aboard and joined RevenueMed as Head of Development center. The mandate was to transform a typical Healthcare BPO company to a technology enabled operation.

I was instrumental in building the technology team as well as defining products and solutions that helped the company to transform their business. RevenueMed achieved the Deloitte “Technology Fast 500” for two consecutive years - 2013 and 2014 and was acquired by Navigant in Feb’ 2015. Technology applications and process automation was a key enabler for RevenueMed to achieve phenomenal growth and valuation.

In 2011, the technology team of RevenuMed was spun out into a separate organization under the brand “RUBY Software” and Joyce became the Managing Director and Co-founder of RUBY. We continue to serve and support RevenueMed as well as to expand our service offerings to build additional clients.

The company, born as WeatherBill, initially helped businesses of all kind hedge against the impact of unfavorable weather events (heat waves, unexpected frost, rain, snow). It later pivoted to focus only on the agriculture sector, which is one of the most-affected industries. The company was sold for $930M in 2013.

The plan also included a roadmap to break up our monorepository and enable the development & release of statically-compiled libraries. Through the collaboration of the entire team, we are seeing impressive compile-time improvements of 10k+ developer hours in the first year.

 As an architect, I participate in activities like giving shape to our Android code reviewer test, investigate third-party technologies integrations, and leading the educational initiatives.

Worked part time as a 20%er on the Youtube EMEA Claims Team under Tiffany Ly (Chief of Staff, Youtube EMEA).

Claims (i.e., key stats) are critical to Youtube to tell the YouTube story, mission, and positive impact to press, advertisers, users, and other KOFs. Claims require executive oversight and cross-functional (XFN) work across multiple Google & YouTube teams in GBO, GAPP (Policy), PR / Comms, Marketing, Investor Relations, and Product to make sure we properly land the key YouTube messages externally. 

To help with this mission, I worked on piloting and building new processes in each region with XFN Leads to better define, prioritize, and land the high-level messages and claims. 

In this role, I worked with senior stakeholders and engaged with global teams across Google and YouTube to help deliver highly visible processes and claims (meant for public / external use).

Led a world-class team consisting of a mix of engineers, data scientists as well as ""dotted line"" product managers. Started and responsible for many personalization/discovery/recommendation products at Twitter. Invented @magicrecs -- a real-time recommendation product that started as a messaging bot and evolved to mobile push notifications, sent to hundreds of millions of users daily. It has since proved to be highly successful for Twitter in terms of engagement and DAUs, and has inspired many similar products in the rest of the industry. Some other projects I worked on: personalized search and autocompletion, graph analysis infrastructure, user reputation system, user recommendations, discover, modeling of user interests and other attributes, tweet topic modeling, engagement prediction, etc.

A quote from my email that I sent to my team at the beginning of 2013 that summarizes the impact of my team: 

""My vision is for a Twitter which knows me better than me, attending to my information needs before they are my needs. This vision might take some time to become real, but it will happen. And when it will, we can look back and be proud and privileged to be part of the team that was the center of it all.""

This vision might take some time to become real, but it will happen. And when it will, we can look back and be proud and privileged to be part of the team that was the center of it all.""

Consumer products are often about processing and delivery of information, services or goods. The biggest ""aha"" for me in my last couple of years at Twitter was the disproportionate value that being real-time provides to such a product. This actually sounds really odd - even to myself now - given that I was inside Twitter, the real-time information network!

As an Azure App Dev Specialist at Microsoft, my job was focused on helping our customers migrate their existing applications and modernizing it onto Azure or roll out the next big project with the most advanced and innovative features onto Azure. During my time as an Azure Specialist, I took on more leadership roles with customer engagements and slowly moved off shadowing my mentors. Some of my highlights from this role included working with Forms Recognizer (one of Azure's new cognitive services at the time), delivering Azure DevOps training, working with a bunch of higher education accounts on Azure Lab Services use cases, and co-leading a Microsoft Cloud Workshop to a room of cloud architects and developers.

During my on-boarding time as an App Dev TSP, I got the opportunity to earn two Microsoft certifications (Azure Fundamentals and Azure Developers Associate). I was presented with the opportunity to work on a technical project, a trash detection system that combines IoT, Serverless, Custom Vision, App Service, and Database PaaS to identify a piece of item, classify it into the right bins and alert the users. I was brought along to various customer meetings to discuss everything Azure related from VMs to DevOps to Azure Kubernetes. As a TSP, my role was to unblock technical difficulties for customers to help win the technical decision. One of my highlights as a TSP was helping co-deliver a 3 hour presentation to a customer and having them reach out afterwards for more.

I became involved with Blueprint when it started in the spring 2013. Blueprint strives to work with Bay Area nonprofits to provide software engineering solutions, free of charge. I worked on two such projects, in one of which I lead the team. I also served as a technology ""chair"", maintaining past projects and doing QA work.

The project I lead is called is a crowdfunding portal for Re-volv, a San Francisco based nonprofit organization which provides community establishments with solar power through crowdfunding campaigns. The project entailed leading a team of four student developers and interfacing with RE-volv to inform our technical decisions. The final product includes:

- Dashboard-style tools for various types of donors and volunteers
- Visualizations of solar investment returns and controls for donors to redirect investment returns into new crowdfunding campaigns
- Payment processing via Stripe, including recurring donations

The portal launched in 2015 at re-volv.org, replacing the existing website. I continued to work with the nonprofit to facilitate their transition of the platform first to offshore contractors then to Zibtek, a web application consulting company.

Call metrics:
Google search traffic is moving to mobile devices, where users increasingly prefer calling advertisers instead of visiting desktop optimized websites. I built telephony infrastructure over Google Voice to track metrics for ads originated phone calls. I also co-led a ten+ engineer team responsible for all phone call search ad formats. Our telephony infrastructure is used by several ads products across search, website, compare, travel, and content. 


Bidding:
Google’s AdWords platform allows advertisers to precisely target highly relevant ads along multiple dimensions such as location, time of day, device, etc. The bid modification framework allows advertisers to easily modify their ad auction bids across all these dimensions with a simple campaign setup. This was the key feature of the AdWords enhanced campaigns launch in 2013, and is one of the most widely used features for AdWords campaigns. I managed the search ads bid modification framework, and helped with successful bid modification related launches by several search ads teams.

Worked on and started several awesome, impactful projects at Google with stellar teams.

Question Answering from the Web (try queries like 'who did the black swan dance in the movie', 'where did cricket originate' on google). Steven Baker (https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-baker-5077885) and I started this project called WebAnswers aka Featured Snippets at Google and built a super strong team. This 'open domain q&a' is a very hard problem in NLP / AI domain. Very happy with the huge success of this project in answering a large fraction of users queries. 

Ranklab is a Machine Learning platform focused on ranking systems within Google. Alex Grushetsky (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-grushetsky-2841731) had phenomenal vision in defining and starting this project. We started Ranklab and I grew and managed a superstar team, and focused on working with the customers of the platform. Ranklab is a very successful project internally in Google, with collaborative efforts with Web Search ranking team, YouTube, Image Search and Google Brain team, all resulting in successful launches.

Search Ranking (improvements to ranking algorithms and signals) - various ranking improvements and lead ranking teams to improve ranking signals / subsystems.

Evaluation and Analysis (A/B testing with human raters, live users, traffic trends using logs). This is a critical part of Google Search and the ability to run experiments easily is extremely critical for complex projects that Google launches. I took over the eval engineering team when it was fairly small and grew it to a large team, drove a lot of improvements in performance and software quality working with strong engineers.

Past projects: 
Realtime Search using Twitter firehose (http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/relevance-meets-real-time-web.html), Tweet replay search (http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/replay-it-google-search-across-twitter.html), Mustang Search performance improvements (working with Rob Stets).

Insight Data Science prepares fellows for a smooth transition from academia into the data science industry. This is split into two parts, the creation of a data science project over three weeks, and several weeks of studying material that academics may not have otherwise encountered.

My project was a consulting project with HackerRank, called HackerRecruit. The idea behind the project was to maximize ROI of recruiters and heiring teams in software industries, by predicting how likely a candidate is going to clear a interview pipeline. My contributions to the project was to predict likelihood of a candidate clearing the phone screening stage (technical) based on his performance in the online technical screening stage. For this project, I used HackerRank's database stored on Apache Spark Cluster for feature extraction, and used a random forest model for training. Finally, I developed a website on AWS as part of my deliverable, demonstrating prioritized sorting of candidates based on the predicted probabilities of them clearing the phone screening.

The integrator provided numerical solutions used for investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement) effects on thermal properties of small quantum systems placed under noisy environment. Study reviled strong dependence of heat current on quantum correlations between the system and the environment.

Computational pipeline for clinical variant prioritization

• Written in Python, this automated pipeline draws from an on-site MySQL database of solved protein structures and homology models to predict the effects of clinical genetic variants on protein function in a high-throughput, automated process
• Online public databases are mined for site-specific annotations, structures are mined for binding interfaces, and stability changes are predicted with the ROSETTA molecular modeling suite
• Weekly reports are generated for variants of unknown significance found in new patients in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and actively used by clinicians to inform treatment decisions

Large-scale analysis of population-specific differences in protein structure

• Evaluated protein-coding variants in the 1000 Genomes Project in the context of all available protein structures in the Protein Data Bank to identify cases where specific populations are underrepresented in the current structural biology knowledgebase
• Combined energetic stability predictions, ligand/protein docking, and public database mining for site-specific annotations to identify cases where human variation may influence structural biology results

Computational modeling of novel somatic mutations

• Collaborated with groups in the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center to model novel activating and drug-resistant somatic mutations found in patients leading to several publications

From 2010 to 2013 I was a member of the Neuromorphics Lab at BU's Cognitive and Neural Systems department. From 2014 to 2018 I continued my research under Dan Bullock. My research focused on reinforcement learning and computational models of the basal ganglia, particularly a model of habit formation and strategic decision making that made use of previously-unmodeled physiological differences in sub-regions of the striatum.

• Laid out system architecture of and implemented 8-segment neural model of hierarchical reinforcement learning with high fidelity to biological neural networks.
• Worked independently to simulate a visuomotor navigation task and 4 pharmacological effects in MATLAB.
• Simulated skill transfer between two independent neural networks during training via a novel reinforcement learning architecture.

The majority of my research at BU has been concerned with learning and adaptation in simulated neural systems. In this video a virtual agent uses a neuromorphic system to explore its environment, learn from its mistakes, and exploit reward (represented as a red 'X'.) Despite lacking any visual or olfactory sense, the model is able to reliably exploit its envirionment in a variety of changing conditions, including movement of the reward and changes in its initial placement.

Hashtag recommender was coded in Python and aims to help users generate a list of optimized hashtags for unlabeled photos. It works by extracting deep features from the input photo and finding six the most similar images from a database of >5,000 Instagram posts. Posts were collected using the search hashtags: #brunch, #food, #cats, #catsofinstagram, #fitness, #mechanicalkeyboard, #nature, #naturephotography, and #tech.

Because recommendations are optimized not only for similarity to image content but also the number of likes associated with each hashtag, the recommendations can be somewhat wacky! But the goal is to maximize engagement using hashtags and not necessarily to describe the image perfectly.

• Designed and deployed Flask web application in production using AWS EC2 instance to improve user experience.
• Wrote modular web-scraper to efficiently automate large-scale data collection from Instagram.
• Developed recommender system using image analysis to extract deep features with CNN.
• Used NLP, Bag of Words, and Skip-gram algorithms to optimize recommendations for maximum engagement.

After realizing that the school was selling PB&Js with barely anything between the breads for an expensive price ($3.50), I decided to sell better products for cheaper ($2.50).

I decided to start within the underclassmen residential area (with $150~200K / year TAM) since other residential areas were much smaller and very sparse. From a survey I designed, I figured out that most people want (to be precise, are fine with) 3:2 PB to Jelly ratio on their sandwiches and preferred Wonder Bread (or had no problems with it). I researched prices of multiple grocery stores and transportation cost to determine the most cost efficient procurement strategy (fancy way of saying where's a reasonably close store with cheap prices). After my first delivery, I set up a communication channel through facebook messenger with customers so I could get feedback after each delivery.

I failed when trying to scale the business. I had 3 major issues - 1) Throughput was too low (couldn't make enough sandwiches in a given time), 2) delivery network didn't exist, and 3) Personnel management. I recognized the existence of first 2 problems and designed solutions - 1) Streamlining sandwich production (1 person spreads the PB, 1 person Jelly, and 1 person puts together the sandwich and packages it) & Designing PB and Jelly dispenser, and 2) hiring students as part-time delivery people.

Without scaling the business, each of the 3 members were making slightly above minimum wage compared to number of hours put in. I failed to sufficiently motivate the other 2 and communicate an upside.
